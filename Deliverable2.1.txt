User Environment
  Organizing a deck of cards from a TCG only involves a single person, and it can take them anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours depending on how many cards they have, how they are organizing them, and which specific games they are using.  Our product will need to be used on a computer or smart phone, although we plan to program it using Java, a highly portable language that can run on nearly any machine.  This ensures that the product can be used by a wide demographic.  The fact that every TCG player needs to organize their cards in some way, and our highly portable design gives it potential to be used by a large portion of the TCG community.
